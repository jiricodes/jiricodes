# About
Aspiring back end developer with a robust soft skills base gained in almost decade as customer service professional and with former education within international business and logistics field.

At the moment I'm practising and developing my skills at Hive Helsinki through coding various project and algorithms, subsequently it also positively affects my rigour, problem solving and time management.

# Hive Helsinki

[Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/) is a coding school following [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)) educational model.

I passed the entrance exams including Piscine, one month of 12hrs+ a day of coding, in August 2019 and started my studies following October. Have been progressing fast through the curriculum ever since.

### [get_next_line](https://github.com/jiricodes/Libft)
Basic function that reads files line by line. Now standard part of my Libft.

### [Libft](https://github.com/jiricodes/Libft)
Part of standard C Library recoded, serves as a base for most of my projects in Hive. Keeps getting updated and refactored as I progress through the curriculum.
